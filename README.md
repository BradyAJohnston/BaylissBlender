In this tutorial you should be able to:
1. Export 3D models of your favourite proteins and protein complexes. 
2. Import and manipulate these models in basic ways in blender. 
3. Colour and texture your scene and set up basic lighting.
4. Render images. 
5. Export your scene as a file usable in Augmented Reality. 

A work in progress.
